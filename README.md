# Shopping List App -   

This is a project i took the idea from my family and the need to control shopping spends!

The project consists of a mobile site using react, and tailwind for the design with the following:

- API requests for time, network and battery from the device.
- Dynamic shopping lists, stored in the devices local storage.
- Modal to create new list, and another to add items to the shopping list.
- Dynamic ingredients list, also stored in teh devices local storage.
- This site is made to be used on mobile. Its not configurated for above sizes.
- Will be adding new features in the future like a recipe list and user connect.
- Hover animation images in bottom footer.
